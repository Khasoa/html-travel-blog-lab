        <p>My trip to Fire Island felt like a simple, peaceful escape. With no cars around, everything slowed down in the best way, and the wooden boardwalks made it easy to wander between the dunes and the wide, quiet beaches.</p>
        <p>The Fire Island Lighthouse was a clear highlight, giving beautiful views once you reach the top. I also loved the Sunken Forest, a calm, shaded spot that feels different from anything else on the island. Altogether, Fire Island is the kind of place that leaves you feeling lighter, like you have stepped away from the noise of everyday life.</p>
